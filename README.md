First repository, hello-world project

I like to eat apples and bananas! 
Although, if I was on a desert island and only able to choose one to eat forever, I'd pick bananas.
Oh apples and bananas - the food of this world never ceases to amaze!

I am a 23 year old college graduate with a degree in Mathematics. I currently live overseas as of summer 2019.
It's fun to use my degree here on GitHub!
